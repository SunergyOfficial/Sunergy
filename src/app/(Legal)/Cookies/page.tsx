          What are cookies?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={inter.style}>
          Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or
          mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by
          website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more
          efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={inter.style}>
          Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Sunergy Inc.) are
          called &quot;firstparty cookies.&quot; Cookies set by parties other
          than the website owner are called &quot;thirdparty cookies.&quot;
          Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be
          provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive
          content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party
          cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in
          question and also when it visits certain other websites.

          Why do we use cookies?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={inter.style}>
          We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some
          cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Website to
          operate, and we refer to these as &quot;essential&quot; or
          &quot;strictly necessary&quot; cookies. Other cookies also enable us
          to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the
          experience on our Online Properties. Third parties serve cookies
          through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes.
          This is described in more detail below.

          How can I control cookies?
        </Typography>

          You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You

          cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide
          you with services.

          What about other tracking technologies, like webbeacons?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={inter.style}>
          Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a
          website. We may useother, similar technologies from time to time, like
          web beacons (sometimes called&quot;tracking pixels&quot; or
          &quot;clear gifs&quot;). These are tiny graphics files that contain a
          uniqueidentifier that enables us to recognize when someone has visited
          our Website oropened an email including them . This allows us, for
          example, to monitor the trafficpatterns of users from one page within
          a website to another, to deliver orcommunicate with cookies, to
          understand whether you have come to the websitefrom an online
          advertisement displayed on a third-party website, to improve
          siteperformance, and to measure the success of email marketing
          campaigns. In manyinstances, these technologies are reliant on cookies
          to function properly, and sodeclining cookies will impair their
          functioning.

          Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?
        </Typography>
        <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={inter.style}>
          Websites may also use so-called &quot;Flash Cookies&quot; (also known
          as Local SharedObjects or &quot;LSOs&quot;) to, among other things,
          collect and store information about youruse of our services, fraud
          prevention, and for other site operations. If you do not want Flash
          Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust thesettings of your
          Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the toolscontained
          in the Website Storage Settings Panel . You can also control Flash
          Cookiesby going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the
          instructions (whichmay include instructions that explain, for example,
          how to delete existing FlashCookies (referred to
          &quot;information&quot; on the Macromedia site), how to prevent
          FlashLSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked,
          and (for FlashPlayer 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are
          not being delivered by theoperator of the page you are on at the
          time). Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit
          acceptance of FlashCookies may reduce or impede the functionality of
          some Flash applications,including, potentially, Flash applications
          used in connection with our services oronline content.
